dihedral-mutinf
===============
This will have everything related to information theoretic measures. Right now I have implemented two ways to 
calculate Mutual Information.
1).Binning data which is implemented in dihedral MutualInformation
2).Calculating Mutual Information using Kraskov's method which is implemented in posMutualCode

Notes:
==============
Make sure you test the code before running it. Both scripts contain test cases for calculating mutual information 
for bivarite distributions that have analytical solutions.
